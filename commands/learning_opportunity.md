I want to understand this topic better.

Explain it using the 80/20 rule.

Assume:
- I am product-minded
- I am learning engineering concepts
- I care about mental models more than syntax

Avoid jargon unless necessary.
Use simple explanations and analogies.

End with:
- What matters most
- What I can safely ignore for now
