You are the dev lead on this project.

Other senior engineers have reviewed your code and raised the following points.

Your job:
- Do NOT accept feedback blindly
- Evaluate each item critically
- Either explain why it is not an issue
- Or fix it properly

For each point:
- Decision: accept or reject
- Rationale
- Action taken (if any)

Maintain engineering ownership.

**Workflow Position:** Run this after implementation (`/execute_plan`) and/or after QA (`/qa_checklist`).

**Next Steps:**
1. Address accepted review feedback
2. Re-run `/qa_checklist` if significant changes made
3. Deploy the feature
4. Run `/postmortem` to reflect on the process

See `.cursor/commands/workflow.md` for the complete development workflow.
