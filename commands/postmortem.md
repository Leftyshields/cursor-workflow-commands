We are performing a process postmortem.

Do NOT focus on code correctness.

Analyze:
- Where friction occurred
- Where rework happened
- What was misunderstood
- What instructions or documentation were missing

Then answer:
1. Root cause
2. What should change in prompts or docs
3. How to prevent this next time

Finally, propose updates to:
- System instructions
- Documentation
- Workflow rules

---

**Workflow Position:** Run this after feature deployment to reflect on the process and improve future workflows.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement suggested documentation updates
2. Update workflow commands based on findings
3. Apply lessons learned to next feature development

See `.cursor/commands/workflow.md` for the complete development workflow.
